# MSFeeDashboard : Post Graduate college visualiser
##This is a dashboard based on Pythonâ€™s framework Dash and Plotly. We have scraped college data for post graduate studies from the web using the Requests library from public websites like Yocket.in. 

The first plot is a choropleth map showing the distribution of colleges in the dataset. Hovering over a country reveals its most popular colleges and the total count.

The second map is a heatmap showing deviation from the average fee in that country. Hovering over each state shows the top 5 universities and its deviation from the average
