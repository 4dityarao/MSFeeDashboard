# MSFeeDashboard : Post Graduate college visualiser
##This is a dashboard based on Pythonâ€™s framework Dash and Plotly. We have scraped college data for post graduate studies from the web using the Requests library from public websites like Yocket.in. 

The first plot is a choropleth map showing the distribution of colleges in the dataset. Hovering over a country reveals its most popular colleges and the total count.

A drop down menu allows you to view by country (currently only USA has been supported)

The second map is a heatmap showing deviation from the average fee in that country. Hovering over each state shows the top 5 universities and its deviation from the average.

The two bar graphs are made on the basis of average fees in each of the prominent locations in the United States and Canada.Colleges were sorted out on the basis of their location(both public and private institutions) and average was calculated for each of the same.
